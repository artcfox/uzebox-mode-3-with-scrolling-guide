<h1>Uzebox Mode 3 with Scrolling Guide</h1>

<p><a href="uzebox_mode3_scrolling.pdf">Here is a comprehensive guide</a> I wrote for the Uzebox on how to use
video mode 3 with scrolling in three different configurations:
  <ul>
    <li>Horizontal Scrolling</li>
    <li>Vertical Scrolling</li>
    <li>Horizontal & Vertical Scrolling</li>
  </ul>
This is something that I wish existed back when I first started
developing on the Uzebox.</p>

<p>It includes diagrams to help explain the relationship between VRAM,
the screen, and your level data, and it walks the reader through
writing the code for each different scrolling configuration line by
line, explaining things as much as possible. The scrolling is
bi-directional, it only loads data for a row and/or column when
absolutely necessary, always loads the tiles into the hidden areas of
VRAM, and it allows you to scroll the screen by up to 8 pixels per
call to the Camera_update function.</p>

<p>It doesn't cover everything, but it should be a pretty good start
for people who want to learn how to use this video mode.</p>

<p>There are full projects available for all the examples in the guide
in its <a href="https://github.com/artcfox/uzebox-mode-3-with-scrolling-guide">git repository</a>.</p>
